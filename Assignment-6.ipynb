    "Q:02:List down benefits of OOP\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "It allows reusing some facilities rather than building it again and again. It is done by using class concept of OOP. \n",
    "data redundancy is one of the greatest advantages of OOP. If a user wants a similar functionality in multiple classes, user can go ahead by writing common class definitions for the similar functionalities and inherit them.\n",
    "Maintenance of code is more of a necessity for any programming languages, it helps users from doing re-work in many ways. It is always easy and time-saving to maintain and modify the existing codes with incorporating new changes into it.\n",
    "With the use of data hiding and abstraction mechanism, we are filtering out limited data to exposure which means we are maintaining security and providing necessary data to view.\n",
    "OOP breaks down your software code into bite-sized. In doing this the broken components can be reused in solutions to different other problems (both less and more complex) or either they can be replaced by the future modules which relate to the same interface with implementations details.\n",
    "Object Oriented Programs forces the designers to have a longer and extensive design phase, which results in better designs and fewer flaws. \n"

    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method \n",
    "A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class. Remembering that an object is an instance of a class the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data\n"

    "Attributes:\n",
